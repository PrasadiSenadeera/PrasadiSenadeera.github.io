		<p style="text-align:justify"><span class="image right"><img src="images/myself/family.jpg" alt="" /></span>My Name is Prasadi Thilanka Senadeera
			 I am currently a master student in New University of Lisbon in Portugal. I was born in 1991 to a 
			 middle-class family in Sri Lanka. My father was a planter, and my mother is a teacher. We are five 
			 sisters and brothers, and I am the second of them. <br>

			 In 1996, I started studying as a child at the school in my village. After spending five years there, 
			 I had a chance to enter the best school of the country from grade five scholarship examination that 
			 changes my whole life as I am today. After admitting to the new school, always I was an outstanding 
			 student during my secondary school and high school. At the end of the secondary school, I was 
			 competence to enter the fore 100 uppermost students of the country with distinction passes for all 
			 subjects in the final examination. Then in the high school, I decided to take up Mathematics stream 
			 in my university entrance examination. Finally, out of around 300,000 students I was lucky enough to 
			 be included in the 10% who gets university entrance opportunity.<br>

			 In 2013, I was entered to the Faculty of Geomatics in Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka as one of 
			 the 84 student who got selected for the surveying science degree program which is the world-class leading 
			 bachelors’ degree relevant to Geomatics in the region of South Asia. During the first five semesters of 
			 the degree program we had to follow the core courses where I have wholeheartedly enjoyed all the subjects. 
			 My original ambition in life was to become a Professional Surveyor. However, it is perhaps unsurprising 
			 that a special interest was grown in me for the field of remote sensing which changed my career aspirations 
			 in this direction. So, by the fifth semester, I decided to change my academic path to specialize in the 
			 field of remote sensing and photogrammetry. Further during the final semester of my undergraduate, I was 
			 selected to complete an internship at Geoinformatics center, Asian institute of technology, Thailand as 
			 one of the two students of the Department of Remote Sensing and GIS who got this great chance. There I 
			 had the rare opportunity to blend my knowledge and experience with the international experts of the field 
			 and absorb their knowledge. Finally, at the end of my four years of undergraduate life,  I could complete 
			 my bachelors with a First class honors and furthermore there I was able to award with a gold medal for 
			 the best performance and the highest final grade point average (GPA-3.82 out of 4) of my graduating class.
			  Moreover, I was brainy to have distinction passes for all subjects that I had followed in my specialization 
			  course.</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify"><span class="image left"><img src="images/myself/me.JPG" alt=""  /></span>
				Because of my academic excellence and the ability to multi-task, I was recruited as a teaching assistant 
				in the Department of Remote Sensing and GIS shortly after two months of my graduation. My duties 
				included to instructing the first year and second year undergraduate students for their land surveying 
				field practices and to deliver practical classes on optical and microwave remote sensing specialization 
				students. After a year in 2018, I was promoted to an assistant lecturer in the same department where I 
				worked. Then as an assistant lecturer, other than conducting practical classes I was also assigned for 
				conducting lectures for remote sensing specialization students and, I successfully designed and graded 
				the practical exams of the end semester examinations.   In the meantime, I worked as a visiting instructor
				 for undergraduate students at the faculty of management studies as well as for graduate master students 
				 at the Faculty of Graduate studies at Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka. Then, in addition to the duties 
				 of the university, I also worked as a resource person for various training programs on GNSS, Google Earth, 
				 QGIS and ArcGIS for land survey professionals and Sri Lanka's revenue department staff. Moreover, I contributed 
				 as an instructor to the students’ real world survey projects such as design a suitable channel 
				 system for the Sri Lanka Irrigation Department by engineering students at Ruhuna University, Design a 
				 suitable race track for the Kothmale International Training Institute by students from University of 
				 Vocational technologies in Rathmalana, Sri Lanka.</p>


				<p style="text-align:justify">However, despite being mostly academic, I have also committed my free time
					 to take part in several scholastic competitions and various extracurricular activities that helped 
					 me grow as a person. I was awarded twice in the year 2004 and 2005 as champions of the all-island 
					 inter-schools’ hockey tournament and won the certificate of merit in the school’s sports ceremony.
					  As an undergraduate, I have participated in extracurricular activities of the university including 
					  sports and fine arts. There, I was able to obtain several awards in the Inter Faculty Spots Meet as
					   2nd runners-up for Badminton in 2015 and 1st runners-up for badminton, 1st runners-up for Netball 
					   in 2014. Also, I have actively participated to different occasions at the university as an 
					   announcer. Then in 2019 while I am entitling as an assistant lecturer, I wanted to enhance my 
					   academic knowledge as well. So, I started applying for an international master's program, in 2019 
					   I was awarded as a full scholar to receive the Master of Science in Geospatial technologies in 
					   Europe which is offered together with the University of Münster, in Germany, New University of 
					   Lisbon and the University Jaume I, in Spain. I am currently studying in the last semester of the 
					   program and working on my dissertation project to develop an automatic road extraction method to
						extract roads form high resolution satellite images using convolution neural network based image 
						segmentation architectures and  morphological operations. Given my history of commitment to 
						excellence, I am confident that I will bring a high level of energy and enthusiasm to any offer
						 I receive in the future. </p>
