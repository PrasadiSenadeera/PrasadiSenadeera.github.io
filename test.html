                            Hello! I’m <strong>Prasadi Thilanka Senadeera</strong>, a Scientific Researcher at the <strong>University of Kassel</strong> in Germany. 
                            My work focuses on the intersection of data science, remote sensing, and sustainable agriculture. 
                            Before moving to Germany, I worked in Portugal as a Data Analyst Engineer, developing solutions that combined 
                            machine learning and geospatial data to support renewable energy and environmental research.
                            <br><br>
                            My academic and professional journey has always been driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and a passion 
                            for transforming data into meaningful insights that make a positive impact.
                        </p>

                            My education began in a small village school in Sri Lanka, where I discovered a deep love for learning. 
                            Earning top results in national exams opened the doors to one of the country’s most respected schools. 
                            Later, I entered the <strong>Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka</strong> to study Surveying Science, 
                            specializing in Remote Sensing and GIS. 
                            I graduated with <strong>First Class Honours</strong> and received a <strong>Gold Medal</strong> 
                            for outstanding academic performance, finishing with the highest GPA in my class.
                            <br><br>
                            After graduation, I joined the Department of Remote Sensing and GIS as a teaching assistant and later 
                            became an Assistant Lecturer. These experiences shaped my love for both teaching and research, 
                            and helped me develop strong technical and analytical skills.
                        </p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify">
                            In 2019, I was awarded a <strong>full Erasmus Mundus scholarship</strong> to pursue a Master’s degree 
                            in <strong>Geospatial Technologies</strong>, studying at universities in Germany, Portugal, and Spain. 
                            During this program, I strengthened my skills in data science, machine learning, and programming. 
                            My master’s thesis focused on <em>automatic road extraction using U-Net image segmentation</em>, 
                            a project that deepened my expertise in artificial intelligence applications in remote sensing.
                            <br><br>
                            After completing my studies, I joined <strong>Startuplo Lda</strong> in Portugal as a Geospatial Data Analyst, 
                            where I contributed to projects in agriculture, climate resilience, and renewable energy. 
                            I later moved to <strong>Cleanwatts</strong> as a Data Analyst Engineer, developing machine learning models 
                            for solar power forecasting and building web tools for energy data visualization.
                            <br><br>
                            Today, as a researcher at the <strong>University of Kassel</strong>, I continue to explore innovative approaches 
                            that combine geospatial data, AI, and agricultural research to promote sustainability and smarter land use. 
                            I’m passionate about solving real-world problems through data-driven science and collaborating with 
                            international teams that share the same vision for a greener future.
