				<h3>Integrate GIS and multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) to find a suitable place to establish a
					landfill at Sabaragamuwa University in Sri Lanka</h3>		
				<p style="text-align:justify">Sabaragamuwa University in Sri Lanka (SUSL) is located in a rural area 
					160 km away from the capital, and the city council does not implement proper waste collection 
					methods. Therefore, the university collects all types of waste at once and disposes it in an 
					open dump. Then, when the dump is full of waste including glass and polythene, it burns out. 
					This poor solid waste management practice causes air pollution, and the leachate produced in 
					the dump pollutes the groundwater surface of the area. A suitable solid waste system is therefore
					 a high priority requirement for Sabaragamuwa University in Sri Lanka. Geographical information 
					 systems (GIS) is an important tool because it not only reduces time and cost of the site selection
					  but also provides a digital data storage for long term management and planning. The main objective 
					  of this study is use GIS and Multi Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to create a map that shows 
					  the right location, establish a landfill to improve waste management, and evaluate the factors 
					  needed to select the right landfill. Finally, this study focuses on performing sensitivity analysis
					   to study output model uncertainty.

				<h3>Automation of multicriteria evaluation for solar farm siting using open source software</h3>
				<p style="text-align:justify"> Together, multicriteria evaluation (MCE) and geographic information 
					systems (GIS) are usually concerned with allocating favorable lands to a particular purpose.
					 This can be achieved by scoring and assigning weights to attributes of interest to decide 
					 whether certain areas are suitable or unsuitable for a particular activity. The objective of 
					 this study is to automate the preprocessing steps used for multicriteria evaluation that 
					 determines site suitability of solar farms using a GIS, allowing user input derived from 
					 Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)<br>

				<h3>Space-time Crash Analysis- for accident in Leeds, United Kingdom</h3>
				<p style="text-align:justify"> <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Leeds-England">Leeds</a> is an urban 
					area located in the metropolitan county of West Yorkshire, United Kingdom. The <a href="https://www.ukpopulation.org/leeds-population/total"> population of Leeds </a>
					as of 2019 rests around 818,085 inhabitants and it is recognized as the fifth-largest city in the United Kingdom with a population density of 
					around 1,416 people per square kilometer. Leeds transportation networks have a prominent reputation in the United Kingdom,as the railway station
					 is one of the busiest in Britain. Despite that According to the <a href= "https://www.leeds.gov.uk/parking-roads-and-travel/connecting-leeds-and-transforming-travel/road-safety/road-traffic-collision-statistics#:~:text=We%20produce%20an%20annual%20report,from%202018%20and%20shows%20that%3A&text=26%20people%20died%20in%20road,of%2073%25%20compared%20to%202017">Leeds City Council </a>, 
					 the urban area averages around 2,000 to 3,000 vehicle accidents per year between 2009 and 2018. Though the overall number of road casualties has 
					 fallen over the last few consecutive years, Leeds City Council reports the number of people killed or seriously injured has risen 4%, hence 
					 the figure is still unavoidable. Therefore, identifying areas with the highest concentration of accidents would be advantageous for minimizing 
					 road accidents related issues and taking proper initiatives for future traffic safety planning, not only for Leeds but for other geographic
					  regions as well. Therefore, this project was developed as a contribution to solving the above issues to identify highly vulnerable accident 
					  hotspots using geospatial technology.	Click <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/62b47f58c2bf45d3bd1350d891b63f5c">here </a>to view

				<h3> Examine the distribution of hospitals in Sri Lanka against the population</h3>
				<p style="text-align:justify"> Spatial analysis of Geographical information has a wide range of 
					applications in our society today since, <br>
					<b><i><p style="text-align:center"> “Almost everything that happens, happens somewhere (Longley, P.A. et al, 2005, p. 4)</i></b><br></p>
					on the surface of the earth or near surfaces. These applications of geographic information 
					systems play a major role in the field of health sciences and have a variety of uses ranging 
					from in-house bed management to global health risk assessment. In this exercise, examine the 
					distribution of hospitals in Sri Lanka against the population. The final results and the visualizations of the study can be found <a href="https://novagis.maps.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?useExisting=1&layers=6256b3efdbc8424f84dc44d6c003672b">here </a></p>

				<h3>Examine the migratory patterns of white-fronted goose in northern Europe </h3>
				<p style="text-align:justify"> <b>Research question:</b> Which land-use types are the white-fronted geese utilizing 
					for stopovers during their migratory routes?” <br><br>
					
					The medium-sized, heavy-bodied white-fronted goose, Anser albifrons, has brown and white feathers with 
					orange beaks and feet and can geographically be found residing across Europe and northern Asia 
					(Cornell University, 2019). This species is known to breed in the arctic and Siberia of Russia during 
					the warmer season in areas of wetlands, ponds and rivers, and winter in agricultural, wetland areas, 
					as well as marshes of Europe (Cornell University, 2019). Nonetheless, at this moment in time, 
					the white-fronted goose possesses a stable population and is considered a least concern for extinction (Ely et al., 2020; Schellinger, 2014).
					Although research has been performed on the preferred land-use for these geese (Schellinger, 2014; Cornell 
					University, 2019), the proportions of each land-use utilized by white-fronted geese for wintering,
					 migratory stopovers and breeding together has not been explicitly stated. 
					The aim for the research is to determine the habitat most favorable to white-fronted geese throughout 
					heir seasonal movements across Europe and northern Asia by proportion. The research objectives aim to
					 determine the preferred habitats proportionally by extracting the land use type (USGS, 1992) of 
					 stopovers from movement data of a white-fronted geese sample population collected between 2007 
					 and 2008 (Wilkelski, 2020) and plotting them by speed and distance thresholds.

				<h3>Geostatistical exploration of surface temperature variation in Sri Lanka from 2010 to 2019</h3>
				</p><p style="text-align:justify"> Comfortable temperature is a key factor for a human beings healthy living. Unfortunately, some
					people often suffer from living in areas of elevated temperature without any escape. Urbanization can
					have a profound effect on a country’s microclimate due to deforestation, industrial activities, air
					pollution from fossil fuel use, multi-story buildings and more. Sri Lanka, a developing country situated
					in South Asia, faces weighty issues such as scarcity of land for its ever-growing population, as well as
					its recent developments. The Sri Lankan government introduced a national initiative for development
					in transportation and tourism that began in 2011. Some government plans include building 1000
					kilometers of highways around the island, as well as six metro regions before the end of 2030. The
					World Bank has given focus to Sri Lanka to help invest in urbanizing their country to transform their
					economy, in their efforts to end extreme global poverty and boost shared prosperity (World Bank
					Group, 2015).
					Although the goal for these development plans are economic growth and to move people out of
					poverty (Clottes, 2014), these unprecedented developments could directly affect the natural
					ecosystem of the country, leading to change in temperature and precipitation patterns. There is much
					evidence that the urbanization effect can have partial responsibility for causing urban heat islands
					(UHI) like cases in southeast China where rapid urbanization has occurred (Zhou, 2004). Since Sri Lanka
					has seen rapid economic and urban growth since 2011, this study aims to evaluate surface
					temperature changes in Sri Lanka from 2010 to 2019. Although the ten-year period is not enough to
					determine an urbanization effect, the analysis will provide insight on potential surface temperature
					trends.</p>
