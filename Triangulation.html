			<p style="text-align:justify"> Triangulation is a surveying technique in which used to establish the required horizontal control for 
				geodetic surveying in hilly and undulated areas. As we all known from simple geometry if all the three 
				angles and the length of one of its sides of a triangle are known, then, the lengths of the remaining 
				sides of the triangle can be calculated trigonometrically. Again, if the coordinates of any vertex of 
				the triangle and azimuth of any side, are also known, then, the coordinates of the remaining vertices
				 may be computed (Agor R, 1996). By extending this concept, in past surveyors tried to find the 
				 coordinates of unknown points using trigonometry. As an institute of awarding surveying science 
				 degrees to the students, in 2016 we were tried to establish a geodetic control network for Sabaragamuwa
				  university premises using this method. This project was carried out by the surveying science students 
				  from the 2011/2012 batch with the cooperation of university academic and administrative staff.  
				  The entire project can be divided into the following steps for easy explanation.

				<h3><b>Preliminary investigation </h3></b>
							
				<p style="text-align:justify">Preliminary investigation is very important in triangulations. 
					The accuracy, geometrical strength, simplicity, and economy of the triangulation scheme depend 
					on the preliminary investigation and  it helps to determine the best planning and management 
					with optimum usage of available resources, achieving the required accuracy and reducing the cost.  
					In triangulation it can be categorized in to two steps as office and field investigation.
					</p>

				<h3><b>Office investigation</h3></b>
				<p style="text-align:justify">Office investigation was conducted to select the best six trigonometric
					 stations from the eight available stations to design the most suitable figure for the project. 
					 for this purpose, we used six indicators such as intervisibility between stations, possible ways 
					 to access the stations, formation of well-conditioned triangles. (angle more than 30° & less than 120°), 
					 the length of the sights (neither too small nor too large), convenience to supply meals to 
					 the trigonometric point and handiness to transfer GPS and precise theodolite. Then we then 
					 formed six groups, each with 14 members, and assigned every group to a specific trigonometric 
					 station. I was assigned to group 2, which is assigned to the new Paraviyangala trigonometric 
					 station

				<h3><b>Field investigation</h3></b>
				<p style="text-align:justify">Next, a reconnaissance survey was conducted as a preliminary field survey. In this survey 
					we used binoculars, mirror signals and smoke to conclude previous findings on station intervisibility. And we 
					examined the terrain to be surveyed, and collected some miscellaneous information regarding, Transport facilities, 
					availability of water resources, availability of labor and camping ground. </p>

				<h3><b>Organization of the program</h3></b>
				<p style="text-align:justify"> The whole triangulation project was limited to a time frame of 14 days. So, the task 
					had to be well prepared to avoid unnecessary delays and extra expenses also it supports to complete the project
					 successfully with its every listed goals and deliverables. Since the areas we have selected are rural mountains, 
					 the villagers are accustomed to hunting with traps and deadfalls. So, we informed about our presence in the 
					 mountains to legal authorities in order to convey the information to villagers as a safety precaution and 
					 also as a legal responsibility. Due to the limited resources available, such as vehicles and surveying 
					 equipment, we had to prepare schedules to share the resources with other trigonometric stations. We also 
					 created a budget overview and a list of necessary equipment and foods. </p>
				

				<h3><b>Field procedure</h3></b>
				<p style="text-align:justify">This is the ultimate mechanism of triangulation. Mainly it is consisting 
					of three sections as Arrangement of Camps and Signal Tower, GPS observations and Angle observation.

				<ol>
				<b><li>Arrangement of Camps and Signal Tower</li></b>
				<p style="text-align:justify" ><span class="image right" ><img src="images/projects/triangulation/7.jpg" alt="" /></span>
						Our trigonometric station was located far from the university premises so, we had to stay inside 
						the forest for two weeks, so as the first task of our 
						field practice we prepared temporary camps inside the forest. The next task was to fix the signal 
						towers on the trigonometric stations. As all observations were directed at the gas lamp that was
						 held vertically above the trigonometric station, the configuration of the signal tower requires 
						 high precision, so we used L-shaped iron bars for this.<br>
						 In addition, when repairing the signal tower, we also pay attention to the facts below,<br>
					<ul>
						<li>The signal tower must be of sufficient height for clear visibility and sufficient 
							space under the plate to set up the survey instruments and for the surveyor’s work</li>
							<li>It must be clearly visible from a distance against any background</li>
							<li>It should provide easy and accurate bisection for the telescope</li>
							<li>It must be able to be accurately centered on the trigonometric point</li>
					</ul>

				<b><li>Global positioning System (GPS) Observations</li></b>
					<p style="text-align:justify">Triangulation was practiced at a time when GPS technology was not yet 
						born. However, the GPS observations were made so that the results of the triangulation process 
						could be compared, and the accuracy can be verified. For this, we use Trimble GPS instruments 
						as a rover station and at the same time the GPS base station was positioned at the Hawagala 
						trigonometric station as it is a 2nd order trigonometric point in the national triangulation system.</p>

				<b><li>Angle Observation</li></b>
					<p style="text-align:justify"><span class="image right"><img src="images/projects/triangulation/21.jpg" alt=""/></span>
					For the measurements of the angles, we used the method of reiteration 
						with eight zeros and there were two sets of observation for both faces (left and right face).<br><br>
						<b>Instrument:</b> Precise Theodolite with least count of 1 seconds and it can be used to measure 
						horizontal and vertical angles.<br>
						<b>Reiteration method:</b> In this method, the station signals are bisected successively, and a value
						 is obtained for each direction in each of the various observation rounds.<br>
						<b>Number of Zeros:</b> Use to eliminate errors due to inaccurate graduations of the horizontal wheel 
							of the surveying instruments and the main idea is to start measuring with different initial 
							values (if/ the measurements are based on eight zeros (i.e. 180/8=22.5, the gap between the 
							initial values must be 22.5 degrees) , in the first round, the measurements start with 0 and 
							the second round it starts with 22.5 and the third round with 45 and so on.) <br><br>
						<b>Angular observations were involved following steps:</b><br>
						<ul>
							<li>Set up the instrument at the trig station with precise leveling and centering</li>
							<li>Set the instrument zero to the first observation point (Hawagala Trig Station) with the face on the left</li>
							<li>Aim the instrument's telescope towards the signal lamp of the next station and improve the vision and 
								record the horizontal angle</li>
							<li>Aim the telescope consecutively at the next 3 stations counterclockwise and recorded three horizontal angles</li>
							<li>Move the telescope slightly to the left at the last station and continue measuring the horizontal angle 
								clockwise again from the last station to the first station and record the angles</li>
							<li>When the telescope reaches its starting point, move the face of the instrument to the 
								right and perform the same steps as for the left.</li></ul>
						This was just for one zero, repeat the steps above for all eight zeros. If a point was unable to bisect
						 due to bad environment conditions, next station was bisected leaving the impossible. However, this neglected 
						 angle had to be located from at least one data set in a possible day.</p>

					<b><li>Calculate coordinates of unknown trigonometric station using field observation and spherical trigonometric 
						theories.</li></b>

						<p style="text-align:justify">The calculation process consists of 11 steps, and all calculations 
							were based on spherical trigonometry and geodetic calculations For more reliable and easier 
							calculations, we used MATLAB software to code the calculation and you can find the codes 
							<a href="https://github.com/PrasadiSenadeera/Triangulation">here.</a>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-4 col-12-medium"> <p style="text-align:justify">
							In angle observation, all included angles of the triangulation network figure were 
							observed eight times so,a mean was calculated as the value to be used for the calculations 
							and the STD was calculated to form the weight matrix for the angles (weight = 1 / STD).
